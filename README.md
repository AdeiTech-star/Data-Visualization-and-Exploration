# Data Visualisation and Exploration Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Visualisation and Exploration portfolio! This repository contains projects and assignments inspired by my coursework, which focused on the statistical and mathematical foundations of data science, as well as practical applications in Python. Here, youâ€™ll find implementations and visualizations designed to analyze, clean, and present data effectively.
----------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“š Course Overview

This course emphasized the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of data visualization and exploration, with a strong focus on:

Statistical data description and analysis
Dimensionality reduction (linear and non-linear techniques)
Time series data analysis
Clustering and geospatial data visualization
Interactive dashboards and effective presentation of results
While programming was not the primary focus of the course, I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks extensively to implement various techniques and bring data to life.
